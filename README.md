USAGE INFORMATION 

1. Clone my repository & open it on any source code editor --> https://github.com/blancahidalgo/logo-generator-eight
2. Open the integrated terminal on index.js
3. Enter “node index.js” in the command line - which will run the app
4. The user will then be prompted to a number of questions in a specific order. This will run within the command line thanks to npm inquirer - the user will have to respond to every question
5. Once completed - the app will generate a logo.svg file - and the user will be able to see a preview of this logo running the live server
